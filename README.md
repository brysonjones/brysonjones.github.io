## Bryson's Portfolio

### Personal Background
Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Bryson Jones, and I am currently in my final year of study for my Master's in Robotic Systems Development (MRSD) at Carnegie Mellon University. Prior to graduate school, I attended North Carolina State University, where I received my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering. While there, I was the Vehicle Dynamics Lead and Team Captain of the Wolfpack Motorsports Formula SAE Team, achieving 6th Place Overall out of ~80 competitors my senior year.

After coming to CMU, I have been exploring various areas within Robotics, and have gained substantial experience in machine learning, motion planning, computer vision, and overall software development. My main interests lie at the intersection of online learning for motion control, and adaptive planning and decision making of intelligent systems.

While finishing my degree, I am also currently a part-time intern at Relativity Space, where I am working on developing autonomous systems for the metal 3D printing and assembly of rockets.
